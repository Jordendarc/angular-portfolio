               a week during school breaks and around 17 to 25 hours during the school year. I participated in an agile work environment taking part in daily scrum,
                sprint retrospectives and sprint planning. On this team, I worked on the salesforce application, writing code in Apex and running SOQL statements.
                Besides that, I also worked on different Spring Boot applications. We use Jira to keep track of sprint information and used Jenkins for deployments
                 into our different environments. Once I completed a story I wrote testing plans for another member in my team to verify that my change or fix worked
                  the way it shouldâ€™ve.</div></div>
